Second Deployment:

I have removed the title screen, for now, and are focusing more on the mechanics.
The player can now move(Jumping will be added later).
Added collision so the player doesn't fall of screen along with other games physics that allow the player to move smoothly.
The next steps will be to generate maps/worlds add obstacles/enemies and integrate animations.
